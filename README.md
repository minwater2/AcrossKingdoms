# Welcome to Across Kingdoms

Please start by grabbing the bow and shooting an arrow, as this is the main way of interaction in this world.

You start on the theme menu selector. In here, you can choose which kingdom you want to start defending. It can be either Samurai world or the Cowboy world. Depending on which kingdom you choose, you will be taken to the level selector of each so you can select the level you want to start playing and the level of difficulty for it. 
**(Only Level 1 and 6 for Samurai and Only Level 1 for Cowboy available)**


If you don't feel prepared yet to start defending your kingdom, do not panic! You can train on the Samurai Range to build your shooting skills.

If you have chosen to start playing instead of practising, you will be taken to the level you have chosen. In here, you will be on a tower from where you will defend your kingdom. Look down, wisps will be flowing near the ground indicating where the enemies will be coming from and the gate they are trying to destroy. Grab the bow and shoot an arrow to the big **START** target in the room. Here is where the fun starts as new waves start and you need to defeat all your enemies before they destroy the gate and you lose the game. Around the level, you can find red barrels which are explosive. Shoot them and the near enemies will blow up in pieces! When an enemy dies a lantern carrying his soul will get spawned. Shoot it before it reaches heaven and it will go to your gate instead to heal it. After you have finished killing all your enemies, a new wave will get spawned. Finish all the waves and you would have sucessfully defended this gate. you can then move to the next gate and start defending your kingdom on a new level.

When you finish the game, either by losing or winning, you will be able to see your final score and you will get handy feedback on your accuracy so you can know the percentage of how many of the arrows you shot actually hit the target, let it be a lantern, a barrel or an enemy!

Now everything is left to you. Good luck and I hope you can defend all the Kingdoms.
